- 👋 Hi, I’m @earthpanic
- 👀 I’m interested in computing in general, particularly networking and security, also computer history.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python alongside my cisco and security learning to further expand my skillset.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small simple projects so that i can get a grasp of using programming more competently.  My current experience of using programming is limited.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
